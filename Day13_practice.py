'''Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
Given two integer numbers, write a Python code to return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.'''

# name = input("Enter Your name:\n")
# num1 = int(input(f"Hi {name} Enter the first Number:\n"))
# num2 = int(input(f"{name} Enter the Second Number:\n"))

# if num1*num2 <= 1000:
#     print("The multiplication of 2 number is : ",num1*num2)
# else:
#     print("The Addition of Two Number is :",num1+num2)

'''Write a Python code to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.'''


# previous_number = 0
# sum = 0

'''Write a Python code to accept a string from the user and display characters present at an even index number.

For example, str = "PYnative". so your code should display ‘P’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

'''Remove first n characters from a string
Write a Python code to remove characters from a string from 0 to n and return a new string.

For Example:

remove_chars("PYnative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, you need to remove the first four characters from a string.
remove_chars("PYnative", 2) so output must be native. Here, you need to remove the first two characters from a string.
Note: n must be less than the length of the string.'''

# finalstr = removechar("Chandan Gowda")
# print(finalstr)

'''Write a code to return True if the list’s first and last numbers are the same. If the numbers are different, return False.'''
